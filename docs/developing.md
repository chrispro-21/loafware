See [start_diagram](start_diagram.drawio) for a simple overview of how the app starts up. Once the app is started it can be accessed your local address at port `5000`, easiest way at the moment is to click the address thats returned on the terminal console and it should open in your default browser (if not copy and paste it manually).

### Runtime
